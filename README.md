ðŸš€ Just launched my latest project: Simple Image Resizer!

As a 3rd year BSCIT student, I'm thrilled to share my new web application that solves a real-world problem - optimizing images without losing quality.

What I built:
âœ… Smart Compression - Reduces file size while maintaining image quality
âœ… Perfect Sizing - Resize to exact dimensions or percentages

âœ… Lightning Fast - Instant processing in your browser (no server needed!)
âœ… Multiple Formats - Support for JPEG, PNG, and WebP
âœ… Real-time Preview - See before/after comparisons with compression stats

Tech Stack:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Canvas API for image processing
Client-side processing for privacy & speed
Responsive design for all devices
This project taught me about image processing algorithms, file compression techniques, and creating intuitive user interfaces. The entire application runs in the browser, ensuring user privacy while delivering professional-grade results.
